# This is the final image we want.
#  First, it sets up the DRF application.
#  Then, it copies over a config file which basically says:
# "if any requests come in whose uri starts with /api/,
# then hand them off to the gunicorn (Django) server, 
# otherwise, serve up the React static files."
# Finally, it copies over the React static files to the place
# where nginx expects them to be.
